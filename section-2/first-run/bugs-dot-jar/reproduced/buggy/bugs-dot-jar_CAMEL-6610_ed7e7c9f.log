Apache Camel Runner takes the following options

  -h or -help = Displays the help screen
  -r or -routers <routerBuilderClasses> = Sets the router builder classes which will be loaded while starting the camel context
  -o or -outdir <dot> = Sets the DOT output directory where the visual representations of the routes are generated
  -ad or -aggregate-dot <aggregate-dot> = Aggregates all routes (in addition to individual route generation) into one context to create one monolithic DOT file for visual representations the entire system.
  -d or -duration <duration> = Sets the time duration that the application will run for, by default in milliseconds. You can use '10s' for 10 seconds etc
  -t or -trace = Enables tracing
  -out or -output <filename> = Output all routes to the specified XML file
